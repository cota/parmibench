 .a) The parallel 'sha' perform digest computation of file and place the digest
     in separate output file by employing input data partition strategy. The 
     process of digest calculation of different files is run parallely by 
     different threads.

     The variable 'PROCESSORS' represents the number of processors.
     On subjected platform its maximum value is 8.

 .c) How to Run.
     Commands to run!
     Command Format: OjbectFileName <StringSearchMethod> Workers <InputFileName> <PatternFileName>!

     Example: 
	       Commands to run!
		 Command Format: OjbectFileName -Sequential(S)/Parallel(P) -Workers!
		 Example: sequential SHA: ' ./sha -S   '!                           
		 Example: parallel SHA  : ' ./sha -P -2 '!
